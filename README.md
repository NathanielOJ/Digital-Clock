# MiniProjects
Mini projects I created for learning and distrubution 
I have made a inventory management app and a weather application using API most of my code I use the languages HTML, JAVA SCRIPT, CSS,AND C#
these are small projects I have created in my spare time to establish experience and knowledge I am still learning but so far I am having fun.
I will create many more projects in future, feel free to check my apps , please extract files before use , the programs I use to create these apps are visual studio code
I use code academy and youtube to create these apps some are simplistic as I am still learning and some are complicated!
